This is a responsive static landing page for a footwear brand.

## Usage

This landing page is designed and developed by me to showcase a footwear brand's products and encourage users to contact the company. It is fully responsive and can be viewed on a desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Through DOM manipulation and the Intersection Observer API, I was able to achieve these features:

- Modal window pop-up

- Sticky navigation
- Reveal on scroll effect
- Image lazy loading
- Tabbed component
- Slider component
